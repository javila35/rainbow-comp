# What is this?

I'm an organizer for a dodgeball league in Seattle. We don't have a central repository to track information about players as seasons go on. I wanted to create a tool to do that and look at changes in the our player base over time.

## Built on

This is a mostly vibe coded project built using Github Copilot. I wanted to test the limits of copilot working on a green field project. It struggled to make the model connections necessary to handle some of the relationships needed to facilitate this kind of app. It did handle frontend code very well.

## Access

This application is hosted but contains names of real people. If you're interested in a demo please reach out and ask.
